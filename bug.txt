///Does initiate application send out emails to non personal emails///
 -- works on local server. Needs testing on live server.
 

///Landing Page is very slow to load///
- Need to add spinning wheel if I can't resolve this issue.


///Need to add spinning wheel on ALL saves///

///Bio doesn't recognize Associates Degree. It saves but doesn't identifiy as that when page loads. ///
- probably a spelling error.

///Inserts for activity logs work///
- Initiate doesn't work
- Submitted Application Works
- Return Application Works
- Save Edit Application Works
- Mark Complete Application Works

///Return Application isn't working///
- Queries work but nothing, but email,save don't come up.

///Resened Verification Code isn't working///
- success is returning failed.
- why is this getting triggered twice
- it looks like funciton is being called once in javascript. However php is getting triggered twice.
- I think it's getting triggered twice because I have multiple accounts with the same data.

==== Testing As Above on a cleared Database ======
 1) Initiate Application still doesn't insert anything on activity log.
 2) Resend Verification Code is now working properly
		- I believe the issue was that there was other applications with the same info. Going to add a swal to prevent in future cases.
 3)Loading the landing page takes about 12 seconds to load. 
 4)Activity Log takes about 7 seconds to load.
