///Does initiate application send out emails to non personal emails///
 -- works on local server. Needs testing on live server.
 

///Landing Page is very slow to load///
- Need to add spinning wheel if I can't resolve this issue.


///Need to add spinning wheel on ALL saves///

///Bio doesn't recognize Associates Degree. It saves but doesn't identifiy as that when page loads. ///
- probably a spelling error.

///Inserts for activity logs work///
- Initiate doesn't work
- Submitted Application Works
- Return Application Works
- Save Edit Application Works
- Mark Complete Application Works

///Return Application isn't working///
- Queries work but nothing, but email,save don't come up.

///Resened Verification Code isn't working///
- success is returning failed.
- why is this getting triggered twice
- it looks like funciton is being called once in javascript. However php is getting triggered twice.
- I think it's getting triggered twice because I have multiple accounts with the same data.

==== Testing As Above on a cleared Database ======
 1) Initiate Application still doesn't insert anything on activity log.
 2) Resend Verification Code is now working properly
		- I believe the issue was that there was other applications with the same info. Going to add a swal to prevent in future cases.
 3)Loading the landing page takes about 12 seconds to load. 
 4)Activity Log takes about 7 seconds to load

===== After Second Release ======
1) Places to add spinning wheel.
	It looks like modal is breaking the spinning wheel.(Fixed)
	- When an Application is initiated. (Fixed)
	- When Verification Code is getting resent. (Fixed)
	- When Application is Submitted (Client Side).(Fixed)
	- When Application is being returned (implementation side). (Fixed)
2) Activity Log
	- Insert doesn't work on Initiate. (Fixed)
3) Things to Consider
	- Changing Business Name to something else? (Keeping the same)
	- Anyone can access the landing page. (Fixed)
	- Adding Session variables to client Application (Fixed)
	- Adding a different photo to Login (Fixed) Ask Boo on her thoughts?
	
4)	Bio doesn't recognize Associates Degree. It saves but doesn't identifiy as that when page loads.(Fixed)
	- probably a spelling error
5)	Add a space after "application" in the return to client email.(Fixed)
6)	Link to Application portal from return Application is broken.(Fixed)
7)	Return Application still has link to localhost. (Fixed)

==== After Third Release ====
1) Make login url replace more dynamic. (Fixed on live server).
2) mysqlind driver needs to be installed in order to use mysqli result. This is an issue on the live server so I'm going to place a workaroun
on all locations.(Activity Log,Initiate Application,Edit Application)
